  - title: Mushroom
    description: 'A mushroom or toadstool is the fleshy, spore-bearing fruiting body
      of a fungus, typically produced above ground, on soil, or on its food source.



      The
      standard for the name "mushroom" is the cultivated white button mushroom, Agaricus
      bisporus; hence the word "mushroom" is most often applied to those fungi (Basidiomycota,
      Agaricomycetes) that have a stem (stipe), a cap (pileus), and gills (lamellae,
      sing. lamella) on the underside of the cap. "Mushroom" also describes a variety
      of other gilled fungi, with or without stems, therefore the term is used to
      describe the fleshy fruiting bodies of some Ascomycota. These gills produce
      microscopic spores that help the fungus spread across the ground or its occupant
      surface.



      Forms deviating from the standard morphology usually have
      more specific names, such as "bolete", "puffball", "stinkhorn", and "morel",
      and gilled mushrooms themselves are often called "agarics" in reference to
      their similarity to Agaricus or their order Agaricales. By extension, the term
      "mushroom" can also refer to either the entire fungus when in culture, the
      thallus (called a mycelium) of species forming the fruiting bodies called mushrooms,
      or the species itself.'

  - title: Etymology
    description: 'The terms "mushroom" and "toadstool" go back centuries and were
      never precisely defined, nor was there consensus on application. During the
      15th and 16th centuries, the terms mushrom, mushrum, muscheron, mousheroms,
      mussheron, or musserouns were used.[2]



      The term "mushroom" and its
      variations may have been derived from the French word mousseron in reference
      to moss (mousse). Delineation between edible and poisonous fungi is not clear-cut,
      so a "mushroom" may be edible, poisonous, or unpalatable.[3][4] The word toadstool
      appeared first in 14th century England as a reference for a "stool" for toads,
      possibly inferring an inedible poisonous fungus.[5]'

  - title: Identification
    description: 'Identifying mushrooms requires a basic understanding of their macroscopic
      structure. Most are Basidiomycetes and gilled. Their spores, called basidiospores,
      are produced on the gills and fall in a fine rain of powder from under the
      caps as a result. At the microscopic level, the basidiospores are shot off
      basidia and then fall between the gills in the dead air space. As a result,
      for most mushrooms, if the cap is cut off and placed gill-side-down overnight,
      a powdery impression reflecting the shape of the gills (or pores, or spines,
      etc.) is formed (when the fruit body is sporulating). The color of the powdery
      print, called a spore print, is used to help classify mushrooms and can help
      to identify them. Spore print colors include white (most common), brown, black,
      purple-brown, pink, yellow, and creamy, but almost never blue, green, or red.[6]



      While
      modern identification of mushrooms is quickly becoming molecular, the standard
      methods for identification are still used by most and have developed into a
      fine art harking back to medieval times and the Victorian era, combined with
      microscopic examination. The presence of juices upon breaking, bruising reactions,
      odors, tastes, shades of color, habitat, habit, and season are all considered
      by both amateur and professional mycologists. Tasting and smelling mushrooms
      carries its own hazards because of poisons and allergens. Chemical tests are
      also used for some genera.[7]



      In general, identification to genus
      can often be accomplished in the field using a local mushroom guide. Identification
      to species, however, requires more effort; one must remember that a mushroom
      develops from a button stage into a mature structure, and only the latter can
      provide certain characteristics needed for the identification of the species.
      However, over-mature specimens lose features and cease producing spores. Many
      novices have mistaken humid water marks on paper for white spore prints, or
      discolored paper from oozing liquids on lamella edges for colored spored prints.'

  - title: Classification
    description: 'Typical mushrooms are the fruit bodies of members of the order
      Agaricales, whose type genus is Agaricus and type species is the field mushroom,
      Agaricus campestris. However, in modern molecularly defined classifications,
      not all members of the order Agaricales produce mushroom fruit bodies, and
      many other gilled fungi, collectively called mushrooms, occur in other orders
      of the class Agaricomycetes. For example, chanterelles are in the Cantharellales,
      false chanterelles such as Gomphus are in the Gomphales, milk-cap mushrooms
      (Lactarius, Lactifluus) and russulas (Russula), as well as Lentinellus, are
      in the Russulales, while the tough, leathery genera Lentinus and Panus are
      among the Polyporales, but Neolentinus is in the Gloeophyllales, and the little
      pin-mushroom genus, Rickenella, along with similar genera, are in the Hymenochaetales.



      Within
      the main body of mushrooms, in the Agaricales, are common fungi like the common
      fairy-ring mushroom, shiitake, enoki, oyster mushrooms, fly agarics and other
      Amanitas, magic mushrooms like species of Psilocybe, paddy straw mushrooms,
      shaggy manes, etc.



      An atypical mushroom is the lobster mushroom, which
      is a deformed, cooked-lobster-colored parasitized fruitbody of a Russula or
      Lactarius, colored and deformed by the mycoparasitic Ascomycete Hypomyces lactifluorum.[8]



      Other
      mushrooms are not gilled, so the term "mushroom" is loosely used, and giving
      a full account of their classifications is difficult. Some have pores underneath
      (and are usually called boletes), others have spines, such as the hedgehog
      mushroom and other tooth fungi, and so on. "Mushroom" has been used for polypores,
      puffballs, jelly fungi, coral fungi, bracket fungi, stinkhorns, and cup fungi.
      Thus, the term is more one of common application to macroscopic fungal fruiting
      bodies than one having precise taxonomic meaning. Approximately 14,000 species
      of mushrooms are described.[9]'

  - title: Morphology
    description: 'A mushroom develops from a nodule, or pinhead, less than two millimeters
      in diameter, called a primordium, which is typically found on or near the surface
      of the substrate. It is formed within the mycelium, the mass of threadlike
      hyphae that make up the fungus. The primordium enlarges into a roundish structure
      of interwoven hyphae roughly resembling an egg, called a "button". The button
      has a cottony roll of mycelium, the universal veil, that surrounds the developing
      fruit body. As the egg expands, the universal veil ruptures and may remain
      as a cup, or volva, at the base of the stalk, or as warts or volval patches
      on the cap. Many mushrooms lack a universal veil, therefore they do not have
      either a volva or volval patches. Often, a second layer of tissue, the partial
      veil, covers the bladelike gills that bear spores. As the cap expands, the
      veil breaks, and remnants of the partial veil may remain as a ring, or annulus,
      around the middle of the stalk or as fragments hanging from the margin of the
      cap. The ring may be skirt-like as in some species of Amanita, collar-like
      as in many species of Lepiota, or merely the faint remnants of a cortina (a
      partial veil composed of filaments resembling a spiderweb), which is typical
      of the genus Cortinarius. Mushrooms lacking partial veils do not form an annulus.[10]



      The
      stalk (also called the stipe, or stem) may be central and support the cap in
      the middle, or it may be off-center and/or lateral, as in species of Pleurotus
      and Panus. In other mushrooms, a stalk may be absent, as in the polypores that
      form shelf-like brackets. Puffballs lack a stalk, but may have a supporting
      base. Other mushrooms, such as truffles, jellies, earthstars, and bird''s nests,
      usually do not have stalks, and a specialized mycological vocabulary exists
      to describe their parts.



      The way the gills attach to the top of the
      stalk is an important feature of mushroom morphology. Mushrooms in the genera
      Agaricus, Amanita, Lepiota and Pluteus, among others, have free gills that
      do not extend to the top of the stalk. Others have decurrent gills that extend
      down the stalk, as in the genera Omphalotus and Pleurotus. There are a great
      number of variations between the extremes of free and decurrent, collectively
      called attached gills. Finer distinctions are often made to distinguish the
      types of attached gills: adnate gills, which adjoin squarely to the stalk;
      notched gills, which are notched where they join the top of the stalk; adnexed
      gills, which curve upward to meet the stalk, and so on. These distinctions
      between attached gills are sometimes difficult to interpret, since gill attachment
      may change as the mushroom matures, or with different environmental conditions.[11]'

  - title: Microscopic features
    description: 'A hymenium is a layer of microscopic spore-bearing cells that covers
      the surface of gills. In the nongilled mushrooms, the hymenium lines the inner
      surfaces of the tubes of boletes and polypores, or covers the teeth of spine
      fungi and the branches of corals. In the Ascomycota, spores develop within
      microscopic elongated, sac-like cells called asci, which typically contain
      eight spores in each ascus. The Discomycetes, which contain the cup, sponge,
      brain, and some club-like fungi, develop an exposed layer of asci, as on the
      inner surfaces of cup fungi or within the pits of morels. The Pyrenomycetes,
      tiny dark-colored fungi that live on a wide range of substrates including soil,
      dung, leaf litter, and decaying wood, as well as other fungi, produce minute,
      flask-shaped structures called perithecia, within which the asci develop.[12]



      In
      the Basidiomycetes, usually four spores develop on the tips of thin projections
      called sterigmata, which extend from club-shaped cells called a basidia. The
      fertile portion of the Gasteromycetes, called a gleba, may become powdery as
      in the puffballs or slimy as in the stinkhorns. Interspersed among the asci
      are threadlike sterile cells called paraphyses. Similar structures called cystidia
      often occur within the hymenium of the Basidiomycota. Many types of cystidia
      exist, and assessing their presence, shape, and size is often used to verify
      the identification of a mushroom.[12]



      The most important microscopic
      feature for identification of mushrooms is the spores. Their color, shape,
      size, attachment, ornamentation, and reaction to chemical tests often can be
      the crux of an identification. A spore often has a protrusion at one end, called
      an apiculus, which is the point of attachment to the basidium, termed the apical
      germ pore, from which the hypha emerges when the spore germinates.[12]'

  - title: Growth
    description: 'Many species of mushrooms seemingly appear overnight, growing or
      expanding rapidly. This phenomenon is the source of several common expressions
      in the English language including "to mushroom" or "mushrooming" (expanding
      rapidly in size or scope) and "to pop up like a mushroom" (to appear unexpectedly
      and quickly). In reality, all species of mushrooms take several days to form
      primordial mushroom fruit bodies, though they do expand rapidly by the absorption
      of fluids.[citation needed]



      The cultivated mushroom, as well as the
      common field mushroom, initially form a minute fruiting body, referred to as
      the pin stage because of their small size. Slightly expanded, they are called
      buttons, once again because of the relative size and shape. Once such stages
      are formed, the mushroom can rapidly pull in water from its mycelium and expand,
      mainly by inflating preformed cells that took several days to form in the primordia.[citation
      needed]



      Similarly, there are other mushrooms, like Parasola plicatilis
      (formerly Coprinus plicatlis), that grow rapidly overnight and may disappear
      by late afternoon on a hot day after rainfall.[13] The primordia form at ground
      level in lawns in humid spaces under the thatch and after heavy rainfall or
      in dewy conditions balloon to full size in a few hours, release spores, and
      then collapse. They "mushroom" to full size.[citation needed]



      Not
      all mushrooms expand overnight; some grow very slowly and add tissue to their
      fruiting bodies by growing from the edges of the colony or by inserting hyphae.
      For example, Pleurotus nebrodensis grows slowly, and because of this combined
      with human collection, it is now critically endangered.[14]



      Though
      mushroom fruiting bodies are short-lived, the underlying mycelium can itself
      be long-lived and massive. A colony of Armillaria solidipes (formerly known
      as Armillaria ostoyae) in Malheur National Forest in the United States is estimated
      to be 2,400 years old, possibly older, and spans an estimated 2,200 acres (8.9
      km2).[15] Most of the fungus is underground and in decaying wood or dying tree
      roots in the form of white mycelia combined with black shoelace-like rhizomorphs
      that bridge colonized separated woody substrates.[16]'

  - title: Nutrition
    description: 'Raw brown mushrooms are 92% water, 4% carbohydrates, 2% protein
      and less than 1% fat. In a 100 gram (3.5 ounce) amount, raw mushrooms provide
      22 calories and are a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of B
      vitamins, such as riboflavin, niacin and pantothenic acid, selenium (37% DV)
      and copper (25% DV), and a moderate source (10-19% DV) of phosphorus, zinc
      and potassium (table). They have minimal or no vitamin C and sodium content.


      Vitamin
      D


      The vitamin D content of a mushroom depends on postharvest handling,
      in particular the unintended exposure to sunlight. The US Department of Agriculture
      provided evidence that UV-exposed mushrooms contain substantial amounts of
      vitamin D.[17] When exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light, even after harvesting,[18]
      ergosterol in mushrooms is converted to vitamin D2,[19] a process now used
      intentionally to supply fresh vitamin D mushrooms for the functional food grocery
      market.[20][21] In a comprehensive safety assessment of producing vitamin D
      in fresh mushrooms, researchers showed that artificial UV light technologies
      were equally effective for vitamin D production as in mushrooms exposed to
      natural sunlight, and that UV light has a long record of safe use for production
      of vitamin D in food.[20]'

  - title: Edible mushrooms
    description: 'Mushrooms are used extensively in cooking, in many cuisines (notably
      Chinese, Korean, European, and Japanese).



      Most mushrooms sold in supermarkets
      have been commercially grown on mushroom farms. The most popular of these,
      Agaricus bisporus, is considered safe for most people to eat because it is
      grown in controlled, sterilized environments. Several varieties of A. bisporus
      are grown commercially, including whites, crimini, and portobello. Other cultivated
      species available at many grocers include Hericium erinaceus, shiitake, maitake
      (hen-of-the-woods), Pleurotus, and enoki. In recent years, increasing affluence
      in developing countries has led to a considerable growth in interest in mushroom
      cultivation, which is now seen as a potentially important economic activity
      for small farmers.[22]



      China is a major edible mushroom producer.[23]
      The country produces about half of all cultivated mushrooms, and around 2.7
      kilograms (6.0 lb) of mushrooms are consumed per person per year by 1.4 billion
      people.[24] In 2014, Poland was the world''s largest mushroom exporter, reporting
      an estimated 194,000 tonnes (191,000 long tons; 214,000 short tons) annually.[25]



      Separating
      edible from poisonous species requires meticulous attention to detail; there
      is no single trait by which all toxic mushrooms can be identified, nor one
      by which all edible mushrooms can be identified. People who collect mushrooms
      for consumption are known as mycophagists,[26] and the act of collecting them
      for such is known as mushroom hunting, or simply "mushrooming". Even edible
      mushrooms may produce allergic reactions in susceptible individuals, from a
      mild asthmatic response to severe anaphylactic shock.[27][28] Even the cultivated
      A. bisporus contains small amounts of hydrazines, the most abundant of which
      is agaritine (a mycotoxin and carcinogen).[29] However, the hydrazines are
      destroyed by moderate heat when cooking.[30]



      A number of species of
      mushrooms are poisonous; although some resemble certain edible species, consuming
      them could be fatal. Eating mushrooms gathered in the wild is risky and should
      only be undertaken by individuals knowledgeable in mushroom identification.
      Common best practice is for wild mushroom pickers to focus on collecting a
      small number of visually distinctive, edible mushroom species that cannot be
      easily confused with poisonous varieties. Common mushroom hunting advice is
      that if a mushroom cannot be positively identified, it should be considered
      poisonous and not eaten.[31]'

  - title: Toxic mushrooms
    description: 'Many mushroom species produce secondary metabolites that can be
      toxic, mind-altering, antibiotic, antiviral, or bioluminescent. Although there
      are only a small number of deadly species, several others can cause particularly
      severe and unpleasant symptoms. Toxicity likely plays a role in protecting
      the function of the basidiocarp: the mycelium has expended considerable energy
      and protoplasmic material to develop a structure to efficiently distribute
      its spores. One defense against consumption and premature destruction is the
      evolution of chemicals that render the mushroom inedible, either causing the
      consumer to vomit the meal (see emetics), or to learn to avoid consumption
      altogether. In addition, due to the propensity of mushrooms to absorb heavy
      metals, including those that are radioactive, as late as 2008, European mushrooms
      may have included toxicity from the 1986 Chernobyl disaster and continued to
      be studied.[32][33]'

    description: "Mushrooms with psychoactive properties have long played a role
      in various native medicine traditions in cultures all around the world. They
      have been used as sacrament in rituals aimed at mental and physical healing,
      and to facilitate visionary states. One such ritual is the velada ceremony.
      A practitioner of traditional mushroom use is the shaman or curandera (priest-healer).[34]\r\n\r\nPsilocybin
      mushrooms possess psychedelic properties. Commonly known as \"magic mushrooms\"
      or \"'shrooms\", they are openly available in smart shops in many parts of
      the world, or on the black market in those countries that have outlawed their
      sale. Psilocybin mushrooms have been reported as facilitating profound and
      life-changing insights often described as mystical experiences. Recent scientific
      work has supported these claims, as well as the long-lasting effects of such
      induced spiritual experiences.[35]\r\n\r\nPsilocybin, a naturally occurring
      chemical in certain psychedelic mushrooms such as Psilocybe cubensis, is being
      studied for its ability to help people suffering from psychological disorders,
      such as obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder. Minute amounts have been reported
      to stop cluster and migraine headaches.[37] A double-blind study, done by the
      Johns Hopkins Hospital, showed psychedelic mushrooms could provide people an
      experience with substantial personal meaning and spiritual significance. In
      the study, one third of the subjects reported ingestion of psychedelic mushrooms
      was the single most spiritually significant event of their lives. Over two-thirds
      reported it among their five most meaningful and spiritually significant events.
      On the other hand, one-third of the subjects reported extreme anxiety. However,
      the anxiety went away after a short period of time.[38] Psilocybin mushrooms
      have also shown to be successful in treating addiction, specifically with alcohol
      and cigarettes.[39]\r\n\r\nA few species in the genus Amanita, most recognizably
      A. muscaria, but also A. pantherina, among others, contain the psychoactive
      compound muscimol. The muscimol-containing chemotaxonomic group of Amanitas
      contains no amatoxins or phallotoxins, and as such are not hepatoxic, though
      if not properly cured will be non-lethally neurotoxic due to the presence of
      ibotenic acid. The Amanita intoxication is similar to Z-drugs in that it includes
      CNS depressant and sedative-hypnotic effects, but also dissociation and delirium
      in high doses."

    description: 'Mushrooms can be used for dyeing wool and other natural fibers.
      The chromophores of mushroom dyes are organic compounds and produce strong
      and vivid colors, and all colors of the spectrum can be achieved with mushroom
      dyes. Before the invention of synthetic dyes, mushrooms were the source of
      many textile dyes.[45]



      Some fungi, types of polypores loosely called
      mushrooms, have been used as fire starters (known as tinder fungi).



      Mushrooms
      and other fungi play a role in the development of new biological remediation
      techniques (e.g., using mycorrhizae to spur plant growth) and filtration technologies
      (e.g. using fungi to lower bacterial levels in contaminated water).[46]'
