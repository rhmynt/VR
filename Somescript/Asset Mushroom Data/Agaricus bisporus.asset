    description: "The common mushroom has a complicated\_taxonomic\_history. It was
      first described by English botanist\_Mordecai Cubitt Cooke\_in his 1871\_Handbook
      of British Fungi, as a\_variety\_(var.\_hortensis) of\_Agaricus campestris.[8][9]\_Danish\_mycologist\_Jakob
      Emanuel Lange\_later reviewed a\_cultivar\_specimen, and dubbed it\_Psalliota
      hortensis\_var.\_bispora\_in 1926.[10]\_In 1938, it was promoted to\_species\_status
      and renamed\_Psalliota bispora.[11]\_Emil Imbach (1897\u20131970) imparted
      the current scientific name of the species,\_Agaricus bisporus, after the genus\_Psalliota\_was
      renamed to\_Agaricus\_in 1946.[2]\_The\_specific epithet\_bispora\_distinguishes
      the two-spored\_basidia\_from four-spored\_varieties."

  - title: Description
    description: "The\_pileus\_or cap of the original wild species is a pale grey-brown
      in color, with broad, flat scales on a paler background and fading toward the
      margins. It is first hemispherical in shape before flattening out with maturity,
      and 5\u201310 centimetres (2\u20134 inches) in diameter. The narrow, crowded\_gills\_are
      free and initially, pink, then red-brown and finally a dark brown with a whitish
      edge from the\_cheilocystidia. The cylindrical\_stipe\_is up to\_6\_cm (2+1\u20442\_in)
      tall by\_1\u20132\_cm (1\u20442\u20133\u20444\_in) wide and bears a thick and
      narrow\_ring, which may be streaked on the upper side. The firm flesh is white,
      although stains a pale pinkish-red on bruising.[12][13]\_The\_spore print\_is
      dark brown. The spores are oval to round and measure approximately 4.5\u20135.5\_\u03BCm
      \xD7 5\u20137.5\_\u03BCm, and the\_basidia\_usually two-spored, although two-tetrasporic\_varieties
      have been described from the\_Mojave Desert\_and the\_Mediterranean, with predominantly\_heterothallic\_and\_homothallic\_lifestyles,
      respectively.[14][15]\r\nThis mushroom is commonly found worldwide in fields
      and grassy areas following rain, from late spring through to autumn, especially
      in association with\_manure. In many parts of the world it is widely collected
      and eaten; however, resemblance to deadly or poisonous lookalikes (see below)
      should be noted."

  - title: 'Lookalike species '
    description: "The common mushroom could be confused with young specimens of the
      deadly poisonous\_destroying angel\_(Amanita\_sp.), but the latter may be distinguished
      by their\_volva\_or cup at the base of the mushroom and pure white gills (as
      opposed to pinkish or brown of\_A. bisporus). Thus it is always important to
      clear away debris and examine the base of such similar mushrooms, as well as
      cutting open young specimens to check the gills. Furthermore, the destroying
      angel grows in\_mossy\_woods and lives symbiotically with\_spruce.\r\nA more
      common and less dangerous mistake is to confuse\_A. bisporus\_with\_Agaricus
      xanthodermus, an inedible mushroom found worldwide in grassy areas.\_A. xanthodermus\_has
      an odor reminiscent of\_phenol; its flesh turns yellow when bruised. This fungus
      causes\_nausea\_and vomiting in some people.\r\nThe poisonous European species\_Entoloma
      sinuatum\_has a passing resemblance as well, but has yellowish gills, turning
      pink, and it lacks a ring."

  - title: Cultivation history
    description: "The earliest scientific description of the commercial cultivation
      of\_A. bisporus\_was made by French botanist\_Joseph Pitton de Tournefort\_in
      1707.[17]\_French agriculturist\_Olivier de Serres\_noted that transplanting
      mushroom\_mycelia\_would lead to the propagation of more mushrooms.\r\nOriginally,
      cultivation was unreliable as mushroom growers would watch for good flushes
      of mushrooms in fields before digging up the mycelium and replanting them in
      beds of composted manure or inoculating 'bricks' of compressed litter,\_loam,
      and manure. Spawn collected this way contained pathogens and crops commonly
      would be infected or not grow at all.[18]\_In 1893, sterilized, or pure culture,
      spawn was discovered and produced by the\_Pasteur Institute\_in Paris, for
      cultivation on composted horse manure.[19]\r\nModern commercial varieties of
      the common agaricus mushroom originally were light brown in color. The white
      mushroom was discovered in 1925 growing among a bed of brown mushrooms at the
      Keystone Mushroom Farm in\_Coatesville,\_Pennsylvania. Louis Ferdinand Lambert,
      the farm's owner and a mycologist by training, brought the white mushroom back
      to his laboratory. As with the reception of white bread, it was seen as a more
      attractive food item and became grown and distributed.[20]\_Similar to the
      commercial development history of the\_navel orange\_and\_Red Delicious\_apple,
      cultures were grown from the mutant individuals, and most of the cream-colored
      store mushrooms marketed today are products of this 1925 chance natural mutation.\r\nA.
      bisporus\_is now cultivated in at least seventy countries throughout the world.[2]\r\nIn
      the U.S., the white button form of\_A. bisporus\_alone accounts for about 90%
      of mushrooms sold.[3]\r"

  - title: Nutritional profile
    description: "In a 100-gram serving, raw white mushrooms provide 93 kilojoules
      (22 kilocalories) of\_food energy\_and are an excellent source (> 19% of the\_Daily
      Value, DV) of the\_B vitamins,\_riboflavin,\_niacin, and\_pantothenic acid\_(table).
      Fresh mushrooms are also a good source (10\u201319% DV) of the\_dietary mineral\_phosphorus\_(table).\r\nWhile
      fresh\_A. bisporus\_only contains 0.2 micrograms (8 IU) of\_vitamin D\_as\_ergocalciferol\_(vitamin
      D2), the ergocalciferol content increases substantially after exposure to\_UV
      light.[21][22]\r\n"
