  - title: 'Known as: Destroying Angel'
    description: "Amanita bisporigera\_is a deadly\_poisonous\_species of\_fungus\_in
      the family\_Amanitaceae. It is commonly known as the\_eastern destroying angel
      amanita,[3]\_the\_eastern North American destroying angel\_or just as the\_destroying
      angel, although the fungus shares this latter name with three other lethal
      white\_Amanita\_species,\_A.\u2002ocreata,\_A.\u2002verna\_and\_A.\u2002virosa.
      The\_fruit bodies\_are found on the ground in\_mixed coniferous\_and\_deciduous
      forests\_of eastern North America south to Mexico, but are rare in western
      North America; the fungus has also been found in pine plantations in\_Colombia.
      The mushroom has a smooth white\_cap\_that can reach up to 10\_cm (4\_in) across,
      and a\_stipe, up to 14\_cm (5.5\_in) long by 1.8\_cm (0.7\_in) thick, that
      has a delicate white skirt-like\_ring\_near the top. The bulbous stipe base
      is covered with a membranous sac-like\_volva. The white\_gills\_are free from
      attachment to the\_stalk\_and crowded closely together. As the\_species name\_suggests,\_A.\_bisporigera\_typically
      bears two\_spores\_on the\_basidia, although this characteristic is not as
      immutable as was once thought.\r\nAmanita bisporigera\_was\_described\_as a
      new species in 1906. It is\_classified\_in the\_section\_Phalloideae\_of the
      genus\_Amanita\_together with other\_amatoxin-containing species. Amatoxins
      are\_cyclic peptides\_which\_inhibit\_the enzyme\_RNA polymerase II\_and interfere
      with various cellular functions. The first symptoms of poisoning appear 6 to
      24 hours after consumption, followed by a period of apparent improvement, then
      by symptoms of\_liver\_and\_kidney failure, and death after four days or more.\_Amanita
      bisporigera\_closely resembles a few other white amanitas, including the equally
      deadly\_A.\_virosa\_and\_A.\_verna. These species, difficult to distinguish
      from\_A.\_bisporigera\_based on visible field characteristics, do not have
      two-spored\_basidia, and do not stain yellow when a dilute solution of\_potassium
      hydroxide\_is applied. The\_DNA\_of\_A.\_bisporigera\_has been partially\_sequenced,
      and the\_genes\_responsible for the production of amatoxins have been determined.\r\n"

  - title: Taxonomy, classification, and phylogeny
    description: "Amanita bisporigera\_was first described scientifically in 1906
      by American botanist\_George Francis Atkinson\_in a publication by\_Cornell
      University\_colleague Charles E. Lewis. The\_type locality\_was\_Ithaca, New
      York, where several collections were made.[5]\_In his 1941\_monograph\_of world\_Amanita\_species,\_\xC9douard-Jean
      Gilbert\_transferred the species to his new genus\_Amanitina,[6]\_but this
      genus is now considered\_synonymous\_with\_Amanita.[7]\_In 1944,\_William Murrill\_described
      the species\_Amanita vernella, collected from\_Gainesville, Florida;[8]\_that
      species is now thought to be synonymous with\_A.\_bisporigera\_after a 1979
      examination of its type material revealed\_basidia\_that were mostly 2-spored.[2][9]\_Amanita
      phalloides\_var.\_striatula, a poorly known taxon originally described from
      the United States in 1902 by\_Charles Horton Peck,[10]\_is considered by\_Amanita\_authority
      Rodham Tulloss to be synonymous with\_A.\_bisporigera.[2]\_Vernacular names\_for
      the mushroom include \"destroying angel\", \"deadly amanita\", \"white death
      cap\", \"angel of death\"[11]\_and \"eastern North American destroying angel\".[12]\r\n\nAmanita
      bisporigera\_belongs to\_section\_Phalloideae\_of the genus\_Amanita, which
      contains some of the deadliest\_Amanita\_species, including\_A.\_phalloides\_and\_A.\_virosa.
      This\_classification\_has been upheld with\_phylogenetic\_analyses, which demonstrate
      that the toxin-producing members of section\_Phalloideae\_form a\_clade\u2014that
      is, they derive from a common ancestor.[13][14]\_In 2005, Zhang and colleagues
      performed a phylogenetic analysis based on the\_internal transcribed spacer\_(ITS)
      sequences of several white-bodied toxic\_Amanita\_species, most of which are
      found in Asia. Their results support a clade containing\_A. bisporigera,\_A.\_subjunquillea\_var.\_alba,\_A.\_exitialis,
      and\_A.\_virosa. The Guangzhou destroying angel (Amanita exitialis) has two-spored
      basidia, like\_A.\_bisporigera.[4]"

  - title: Description
    description: "The\_cap\_is 3\u201310\_cm (1.2\u20133.9\_in) in diameter and,
      depending on its age, ranges in shape from egg-shaped to convex to somewhat
      flattened. The cap surface is smooth and white, sometimes with a pale tan-
      or cream-colored tint in the center. The surface is either dry or, when the
      environment is moist, slightly sticky. The\_flesh\_is thin and white, and does
      not change color when bruised.[11]\_The margin of the cap, which is rolled
      inwards in young specimens, does not have striations (grooves), and lacks\_volval\_remnants.
      The\_gills, also white, are crowded closely together. They are either free
      from attachment to the\_stipe\_or just barely reach it. The lamellulae (short
      gills that do not extend all the way to the stipe) are numerous, and gradually
      narrow.\r\n\r\nThe white stipe is 6\u201314\_cm (2.4\u20135.5\_in) by 0.7\u20131.8\_cm
      (0.3\u20130.7\_in) thick, solid (i.e., not hollow), and tapers slightly upward.
      The surface, in young specimens especially, is frequently floccose (covered
      with tufts of soft hair), fibrillose (covered with small slender fibers), or
      squamulose (covered with small scales); there may be fine grooves along its
      length. The bulb at the base of the stipe is spherical or nearly so. The delicate\_ring\_on
      the upper part of the stipe is a remnant of the\_partial veil\_that extends
      from the cap margin to the stalk and covers the gills during development. It
      is white, thin, membranous, and hangs like a skirt. When young, the mushrooms
      are enveloped in a membrane called the\_universal veil, which stretches from
      the top of the cap to the bottom of the stipe, imparting an oval, egg-like
      appearance. In mature fruit bodies, the veil's remnants form a membrane around
      the base, the volva, like an eggshell-shaped cup. On occasion, however, the
      volva remains underground or gets torn up during development. It is white,
      sometimes lobed, and may become pressed closely to the stipe.[15]\_The volva
      is up to 3.8\_cm (1.5\_in) in height (measured from the base of the bulb),
      and is about 2\_mm thick midway between the top and the base attachment.[12]\_The
      mushroom's odor has been described as \"pleasant to somewhat nauseous\",[11]\_becoming
      more\_cloying\_as the fruit body ages.[12]\_The cap flesh turns yellow when
      a solution of\_potassium hydroxide\_(KOH, 5\u201310%) is applied (a common\_chemical
      test\_used in mushroom identification). This characteristic chemical reaction
      is shared with\_A.\_ocreata\_and\_A.\_virosa, although some authors have expressed
      doubt about the identity of North American\_A.\_virosa, suggesting those collections
      may represent four-spored\_A.\_bisporigera.[12][16]\_Tulloss suggests that
      reports of\_A.\_bisporigera\_that do not turn yellow with KOH were actually
      based on white forms of\_A.\u2002phalloides.[12]\_Findings from the\_Chiricahua
      Mountains\_of\_Arizona\_and in central Mexico, although \"nearly identical\"
      to\_A.\_bisporigera, do not stain yellow with KOH; their taxonomic status has
      not been investigated in detail.[2]\r\n"

  - title: Microscopic features
    description: "The\_spore print\_of\_A.\_bisporigera, like most\_Amanita, is white.
      The\_spores\_are roughly spherical, thin-walled,\_hyaline\_(translucent),\_amyloid,
      and measure 7.8\u20139.6 by 7.0\u20139.0\_\u03BCm. The\_cap cuticle\_is made
      of partially gelatinized, filamentous interwoven\_hyphae, 2\u20136\_\u03BCm
      in diameter. The tissue of the gill is bilateral, meaning it diverges from
      the center of the gill to its outer edge. The subhymenium is ramose\u2014composed
      of relatively thin branching, unclamped hyphae. The spore-bearing cells, the\_basidia,
      are club-shaped, thin-walled, without clamps, with dimensions of 34\u201345
      by 4\u201311\_\u03BCm. They are typically two-spored, although rarely three-
      or four-spored forms have been found.[15]\_Although the two-spored basidia
      are a defining characteristic of the species, there is evidence of a tendency
      to shift towards producing four-spored basidia as the fruiting season progresses.[12]\_The
      volva is composed almost exclusively of densely interwoven filamentous hyphae,
      2\u201310\_\u03BCm in diameter, that are sparsely to moderately branched. There
      are few small inflated cells, which are mostly spherical to broadly elliptic.
      The tissue of the stipe is made of abundant, sparsely branched, filamentous
      hyphae, without clamps, measuring 2\u20135\_\u03BCm in diameter. The inflated
      cells are club-shaped, longitudinally oriented, and up to 2\u20133 by 15.7\_\u03BCm.
      The annulus is made of abundant moderately branched filamentous hyphae, measuring
      2\u20136\_\u03BCm in diameter. The inflated cells are sparse, broadly elliptic
      to pear-shaped, and are rarely larger than 31 by 22\_\u03BCm.[15]\_Pleurocystidia\_and\_cheilocystidia\_(cystidia\_found
      on the gill faces and edges, respectively) are absent, but there may be cylindrical
      to sac-like cells of the partial veil on the gill edges; these cells are hyaline
      and measure 24\u201334 by 7\u201316\_\u03BCm.[11]\r\n\r\nIn 1906 Charles E.
      Lewis studied and illustrated the development of the basidia in order to compare
      the\_nuclear\_behavior of the two-spored with that of the four-spored forms.
      Initially (1), the young basidium, appearing as a club-shaped branch from the
      subhymenium, is filled with\_cytoplasm\_and contains two primary nuclei, which
      have distinct\_nucleoli. As the basidium grows larger, the membranes of the
      two nuclei contact (2), and then the membrane disappears at the point of contact
      (3). The two primary nuclei remain distinct for a short time, but eventually
      the two nuclei fuse completely to form a larger secondary nucleus with a single
      secondary nucleolus (4, 5). The basidium increases in size after the primary
      nuclei fuse, and the nucleus migrates towards the end of the basidia (6, 7).
      During this time, the nucleus develops\_vacuoles\_\"filled by the nuclear sap
      in the living cell\".\_Chromosomes\_are produced from the nucleolar threads,
      and align transversely near the apex of the basidium, connected by\_spindles\_(8\u201310).
      The chromosomes then move to the poles, forming the daughter nuclei that occupy
      different positions in the basidium; the daughters now have a structure similar
      to that of the parent nuclei (11). The two nuclei then divide to form four
      nuclei, similar to fungi with four-spored basidia (12, 13). The four nuclei
      crowd together at some distance from the end of the basidium to form an irregular
      mass (14). Shortly thereafter, the sterigmata (slender projections of the basidia
      that attach the spores) begin to form (15), and cytoplasm begins to pass through
      the sterigmata to form the spores (16). Although Lewis was not able to clearly
      determine from observation alone whether the contents of two or four nuclei
      passed through the sterigmata, he deduced, by examining older basidia with
      mature spores, that only two nuclei enter the spores (16, 17).[5]\r\n"

  - title: Toxicity
    description: "Amanita bisporigera\_is considered the most toxic North American\_Amanita\_mushroom,
      with little variation in toxin content between different fruit bodies.[17][18]\_Three
      subtypes of amatoxin have been described:\_\u03B1-,\_\u03B2, and\_\u03B3-amanitin.
      The principal amatoxin, \u03B1-amanitin, is readily absorbed across the intestine,
      and 60% of the absorbed toxin is excreted into\_bile\_and undergoes\_enterohepatic
      circulation; the kidneys clear the remaining 40%. The toxin\_inhibits\_the
      enzyme\_RNA polymerase II, thereby interfering with\_DNA transcription, which
      suppresses RNA production and\_protein synthesis. This causes cellular\_necrosis,
      especially in cells which are initially exposed and have rapid rates of protein
      synthesis. This process results in severe acute liver dysfunction and, ultimately,\_liver
      failure.[19]\_Amatoxins are not broken down by boiling, freezing, or drying.[20][21]\_Roughly
      0.2 to 0.4\_milligrams\_of \u03B1-amanitin is present in 1\_gram of\_A.\_bisporigera;
      the\_lethal dose\_in humans is less than 0.1\_mg/kg body weight.[19]\_One mature
      fruit body can contain 10\u201312\_mg of \u03B1-amanitin, enough for a lethal
      dose.[22]\_The \u03B1-amanitin concentration in the spores is about 17% that
      of the fruit body tissues.[23]\_A.\_bisporigera\_also contains the\_phallotoxin\_phallacidin,
      structurally related to the amatoxins but considered less poisonous because
      of poor absorption.[22]\_Poisonings (from similar white amanitas) have also
      been reported in domestic animals, including dogs, cats, and cows.[24]\r\nThe
      first reported poisonings resulting in death from the consumption of\_A.\_bisporigera\_were
      from near\_San Antonio, Mexico, in 1957, where a rancher, his wife, and three
      children consumed the fungus; only the man survived.[25]\_Amanita\_poisoning
      is characterized by the following distinct stages:[26]\_the\_incubation stage\_is
      an\_asymptomatic\_period which ranges from 6 to 12 hours after ingestion. In
      the\_gastrointestinal stage, about 6 to 16 hours after ingestion, there is
      onset of abdominal pain, explosive vomiting, and diarrhea for up to 24 hours,
      which may lead to dehydration, severe\_electrolyte\_imbalances, and\_shock.
      These early symptoms may be related to other toxins such as\_phalloidin. In
      the cytotoxic stage, 24 to 48 hours after ingestion, clinical and biochemical
      signs of liver damage are observed, but the patient is typically free of gastrointestinal
      symptoms. The signs of liver dysfunction such as\_jaundice,\_hypoglycemia,\_acidosis,
      and\_hemorrhage\_appear. Later, there is an increase in the levels of\_prothrombin\_and
      blood levels of\_ammonia, and the signs of\_hepatic encephalopathy\_and/or\_kidney
      failure\_appear. The\_risk factors\_for mortality that have been reported are
      age younger than 10 years, short latency period between ingestion and onset
      of symptoms, severe\_coagulopathy\_(blood clotting disorder), severe\_hyperbilirubinemia\_(jaundice),
      and rising serum\_creatinine\_levels.[19]"
