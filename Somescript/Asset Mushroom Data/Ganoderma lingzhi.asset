  - title: Taxonomy and ecology
    description: "Lingzhi, also known as\_reishi, is the ancient \"mushroom of immortality\",
      revered for over 2,000 years. Uncertainty exists about which\_Ganoderma\_species
      was most widely utilized as lingzhi mushroom in ancient times, and likely a
      few different common species were considered interchangeable. However, in the
      16th century Chinese herbal compendium, the\_Bencao Gangmu\_(1578), a number
      of different lingzhi-like mushrooms were used for different purposes and defined
      by color. No exact current species can be attached to these ancient lingzhi
      for certain, but according to Dai et al. (2017),[7]\_as well as other researchers
      and based on molecular work, red reishi is most likely to be\_Ganoderma lingzhi\_(Sheng
      H. Wu, Y. Cao & Y.C. Dai, 2012). This is the species that is most widely found
      in Chinese herb shops today, and the fruiting bodies are widely cultivated
      in China and shipped to many other countries. About 7-10 other\_Ganoderma\_species
      are also sold in some shops, but have different Chinese and Latin names and
      are considered different in their activity and functions. The differences are
      based on concentrations of triterpenes such as ganoderic acid and its derivatives
      which vary widely among species. Research on the genus is on-going, but a number
      of recent phylogentic analyses have been published in the last number of years.\_[8]
      \r\n\r\n<b>Nomenclature</b>\r\nPetter Adolf Karsten\_named the genus\_Ganoderma\_in
      1881.[9]\_English botanist\_William Curtis\_gave the fungus its first binomial
      name,\_Boletus lucidus, in 1781.[10]\_The lingzhi's\_botanical names\_have\_Greek
      and Latin roots.\_Ganoderma\_derives from the\_Greek\_ganos\_(\u03B3\u03B1\u03BD\u03BF\u03C2;
      \"brightness\"), and\_derma\_(\u03B4\u03B5\u03C1\u03BC\u03B1; \"skin; together;
      shining skin\").[11]\_The\_specific epithet,\_lingzhi,\_comes from\_Chinese,
      meaning \"divine mushroom.\"\r\nWith the advent of genome sequencing, the genus\_Ganoderma\_has
      undergone taxonomic reclassification. Prior to genetic analyses of fungi, classification
      was done according to morphological characteristics such as size and color.
      The internal transcribed spacer region of the Ganoderma genome is considered
      to be a standard barcode marker.[12]\r\n\n<b>Varieties</b>\r\nIt was once thought
      that\_Ganoderma lingzhi\_generally occurred in two growth forms: a large,\_sessile,
      specimen with a small or nonexistent stalk, found in North America, and a smaller
      specimen with a long, narrow stalk found mainly in the tropics. However, recent
      molecular evidence has identified the former, stalkless, form as a distinct
      species called\_G. sessile, a name given to North American specimens by William
      Alfonso Murrill in 1902.[8][13]\r\nEnvironmental conditions play a substantial
      role in the lingzhi's manifest morphological characteristics. For example,
      elevated\_carbon dioxide\_levels result in stem\_elongation\_in lingzhi. Other
      formations include antlers without a cap, which may also be related to carbon
      dioxide levels. The three main factors that influence fruit body development
      morphology are light, temperature, and humidity. While water and air quality
      play a role in fruit body development morphology, they do so to a lesser degree.[14]\r\n\n<b>Habitat</b>\r\nGanoderma
      lingzhi\_is found in Asia growing as a\_parasite\_or\_saprotroph\_on a variety
      of trees.[15]\_Ganoderma curtisii\_and\_Ganoderma ravenelii\_are the closest
      relatives of the lingzhi mushroom in North America.[16]\r\nIn the wild, lingzhi
      grows at the base and stumps of deciduous trees, especially that of the maple.[17]\_Only
      two or three out of 10,000 such aged trees will have lingzhi growth, and therefore
      it is extremely rare in its natural form.[citation needed]\_Today, lingzhi
      is effectively cultivated on hardwood logs or sawdust/woodchips.[18]\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    description: "The word\_lingzhi\_(\u9748\u829D) was first recorded in a\_fu\_(\u8CE6;
      \"rhapsody; prose-poem\") by the\_Han dynasty\_polymath\_Zhang Heng\_(CE) (Common
      Era) 78\u2013139). His\_Xijing fu\_(\u897F\u4EAC\u8CE6) (Western Metropolis
      Rhapsody) contains a description of the 104 BCE\_Jianzhang Palace\_of\_Emperor
      Wu of Han\_that parallels\_lingzhi\_with\_shijun\_(\u77F3\u83CC; \"rock mushroom\"):
      \"Raising huge breakers, lifting waves, That drenched the stone mushrooms on
      the high bank, And soaked the magic fungus on vermeil boughs.\"[19]\_The commentary
      by\_Xue Zong\_(d. 237) notes that these fungi were eaten as drugs of immortality.\r\nThe\_Shennong
      bencao jing\_(Divine Farmer's Classic of Pharmaceutics) of c.200\u2013250 CE,
      classifies\_zhi\_into six color categories, each of which is believed to benefit
      the\_qi, or \"life force\", in a different part of the body:\_qingzhi\_(\u9752\u829D;
      \"Green Mushroom\") for the liver,\_chizhi\_(\u8D64\u829D; \"Red Mushroom\")
      for the heart,\_huangzhi\_(\u9EC3\u829D; \"Yellow Mushroom\") for the spleen,\_baizhi\_(\u767D\u829D;
      \"White Mushroom\") for the lungs,\_heizhi\_(\u9ED1\u829D; \"Black Mushroom\")
      for the kidneys, and\_zizhi\_(\u7D2B\u829D; \"Purple Mushroom\") for the Essence.
      Commentators identify the red\_chizhi, or\_danzhi\_(\u4E39\u829D; \"cinnabar
      mushroom\"), as the\_lingzhi.\r\nChi Zhi\_(Ganoderma rubra) is bitter and balanced.
      It mainly treats binding in the chest, boosts the heart qi, supplements the
      center, sharpens the wits, and [causes people] not to forget [i.e., improves
      the memory]. Protracted taking may make the body light, prevent senility, and
      prolong life so as to make one an immortal. Its other name is\_Dan Zhi\_(Cinnabar
      Ganoderma). It grows in mountains and valleys.[20][21] \r\n\r\nChinese texts
      have recorded medicinal uses of\_lingzhi\_for more than 2,000 years, a few
      sources erroneously claim its use can be traced back more than 4,000 years.[22]\r\nThe
      (1596)\_Bencao Gangmu\_(Compendium of Materia Medica) has a\_Zhi\_(\u829D)
      category that includes six types of\_zhi\_(calling the green, red, yellow,
      white, black, and purple mushrooms of the\_Shennong bencao jing\_the\_liuzhi\_(\u516D\u829D;
      \"six mushrooms\") and sixteen other fungi, mushrooms, and lichens, including\_mu'er\_(\u6728\u8033;
      \"wood ear\"; \"cloud ear fungus\",\_Auricularia auricula-judae). The author\_Li
      Shizhen\_classified these six differently colored\_zhi\_as\_xiancao\_(\u4ED9\u8349;
      \"immortality herbs\"), and described the effects of\_chizhi\_(\"red mushroom\"):
      {{Quote|text=It positively affects the life-energy, or\_Qi\_of the heart, repairing
      the chest area and benefiting those with a knotted and tight chest. Taken over
      a long period of time, the agility of the body will not cease, and the years
      are lengthened to those of the Immortal Fairies.[23][24]\r\nStuart and Smith's
      classic study of\_Chinese herbology\_describes the\_zhi.\r\n\u829D (Chih) is
      defined in the classics as the plant of immortality, and it is therefore always
      considered to be a felicitous one. It is said to absorb the earthy vapors and
      to leave a heavenly atmosphere. For this reason, it is called \u9748\u829D
      (Ling-chih.) It is large and of a branched form, and probably represents\_Clavaria\_or\_Sparassis.
      Its form is likened to that of coral.[25]\r\nThe\_Bencao Gangmu\_does not list\_lingzhi\_as
      a variety of\_zhi, but as an alternate name for the\_shi'er\_(\u77F3\u8033;
      \"stone ear\",\_Umbilicaria esculenta) lichen. According to Stuart and Smith,\r\n[The
      \u77F3\u8033 Shih-erh is] edible, and has all of the good qualities of the
      \u829D (Chih), it is also being used in the treatment of\_gravel, and said
      to benefit virility. It is specially used in hemorrhage from the bowels and
      prolapse of the rectum. While the name of this would indicate that it was one
      of the\_Auriculariales, the fact that the name \u9748\u829D (Ling-chih) is
      also given to it might place it among the\_Clavariaceae.[25]\r\nIn\_Chinese
      art, the\_lingzhi\_symbolizes great health and longevity, as depicted in the
      imperial\_Forbidden City\_and\_Summer Palace.[26]\_It was a\_talisman\_for
      luck in the traditional\_culture of China, and the goddess of healing\_Guanyin\_is
      sometimes depicted holding a lingzhi mushroom.[24]"

      grain, and wood logs. After formation of the fruiting body, lingzhi is most
      commonly harvested, dried, ground, and processed into tablets or capsules to
      be directly ingested or made into tea or soup. Other lingzhi products include
      processed fungal mycelia or spores.[40]\_Lingzhi is also used to create\_mycelium\_bricks,\_mycelium
      furniture, and leather-like products.[42] "
