      head mushroom,\_bearded tooth mushroom,\_satyr's beard,\_bearded hedgehog mushroom,\_pom
      pom mushroom, or\_bearded tooth fungus) is an\_edible\_mushroom belonging to
      the\_tooth fungus\_group. Native to\_North America,\_Europe\_and\_Asia, it
      can be identified by its long spines (greater than 1\_cm length), occurrence
      on hardwoods, and tendency to grow a single clump of dangling spines. The\_fruit
      bodies\_can be harvested for culinary use. There is no\_high-quality evidence
      from clinical research\_to indicate that lion's mane mushroom has medicinal
      properties.[1]\r\nHericium erinaceus\_can be mistaken for other species of\_Hericium,
      which grow across the same range. In the wild, these mushrooms are common during
      late summer and fall on hardwoods, particularly\_American beech. Usually\_H.
      erinaceus\_is considered\_saprophytic, as it mostly feeds on dead trees.[1]\_However,
      it can also be found on living trees, so may be a tree\_parasite\_as well.
      This could indicate an\_endophytic\_habitat.[1] \r\n\r\n<b>Common names</b>
      \r\n\r\nBoth the Latin genus name\_Hericium\_and the species name\_erinaceus\_mean
      'hedgehog' in Latin. This is also reflected by the German name,\_Igel-Stachelbart\_(literally,\_hedgehog
      goatee), and some of its common English names, such as\_bearded hedgehog\_and\_hedgehog
      mushroom.[1] "

    description: "The fruitbodies of\_H. erinaceus\_are mainly produced annually
      from August to November in Europe.[5]\_It was observed that\_H. erinaceus\_could
      fruit intermittently for 20 years on the same dead tree. It is hypothesized
      that\_H. erinaceus\_can survive for 40 years.[2]\_The mating system of\_H.
      erinaceus\_species found in the USA was shown to be\_bifactorially heterothallic.[6]\r\nThe\_monokaryotic\_mycelium
      growth of\_H.erinaceus\_is slower than\_dikaryotic\_growth and only about a
      low percentage of monokaryotic cultures yield fruitbodies. Monokaryotic fruitbodies
      are also smaller than dikaryotic fruitbodies.[2]\_The monokaryotic mycelium
      was found to produce fusoid to subglobose\_chlamydospores\_of 6\u20138 x 8\u201310\_um
      size. These spores can stay viable for more than seven years and be stored
      under anaerobic conditions.[citation needed]\_Chlamydospore germination requires
      30 to 52 hours, with a germination success rate of 32 to 54%.[6]\r\nSpore production
      is highest at midday, relative to temperature increase and relative humidity
      decrease. Daily trends towards lower relative humidity can favor sporulation,
      however levels of relative humidity that are too low do not favor high total
      spore production.[7]\r\n"

  - title: 'Cultivation '
    description: "<b>Substrate requirements\r</b>\nAs a\_saprophyte\_that occurs
      on dead wood,\_H. erinaceus\_requires adequate\_substrate\_factors, including
      suitable carbon and nitrogen sources, a certain pH value and ideal\_carbon/nitrogen
      ratio.[21]\r\nMany different substrates have been successfully used for this
      mushroom cultivation. Depending on the type of cultivation, the substrate can
      be either solid (artificial log) or liquid (submerged culture and deep submerged
      culture).\r\nThe solid substrate is most commonly a mixture of\_sawdust\_of\_hardwood\_or\_conifer\_containing
      different complements that may include\_wheat bran, wheat\_straw,\_soybean
      meal,\_corn meal,\_rice bran\_and rice straw. For example,\_H. erinaceus\_strains
      grow on beech sawdust substrate enriched with\_wheat bran\_(20%),\_rye\_grain
      (25%),\_soybean meal\_(7%),\_rapeseed\_meal (10%) or meat-osseous\_flour (6%).[12]\r\nAn
      example of a liquid substrate composition can be\_glucose\_for the carbon source,
      soybean powder, corn powder, and wheat bran powder as a complex nitrogen source.[21]\_The
      pH values most suitable for the favorable growth of\_H. erinaceus\_were in
      the range of 5.0 - 9.0, with pH 6.0 as optimal.[22]\r\n\n<b>Climate requirements\r</b>\nH.
      erinaceus\_requires a humid environment for its growth: 85 to 90% of relative
      humidity in the air.[2]\_The incubation temperature most suitable for the\_mycelial\_growth
      of\_H. erinaceus\_was found to be 25\_\xB0C,[22]\_and the optimum temperature
      for vegetative growth was 26\_\xB0C.[22]\_H. erinaceus\_is unable to grow with
      a\_water potential\_lower than -5 Mpa.[10]\r\n\n<b>Cultivation techniques\r</b>\nThe
      artificial cultivation of\_H. erinaceus\_was first reported in China in 1988.[citation
      needed]\_It is cultivated using artificial logs, bottles and polypropylene
      bags. However, this type of artificial cultivation is not suitable for industrialized
      production due to its low yield and long cultivation cycles.[21]\r\nSubmerged
      culture is a type of artificial cultivation of\_H. erinaceus\_whereby the fungus
      is grown in a liquid medium. Using this method, a large number of mycelia can
      be obtained quickly.[21]\_Bioactive compounds can be sourced from the fruiting
      bodies, submerged-cultivated mycelial biomass or liquid-cultivated broth. Growers
      optimize the culture medium composition to obtain simultaneously high yields
      of\_H. erinaceus\_mycelial biomass,\_exopolysaccharides, and\_polysaccharides.[citation
      needed]\_Submerged\_fermentation\_is preferable for the production of mycelial
      biomass and biologically active metabolites in order to produce a more uniform
      biomass and\_extract\_products.[23]\r\nGrowth regulators, such as\_2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic
      acid\_and\_gibberellin, were observed to have an advantageous impact on spore
      germination.[24]\_Other technologies, like red and green laser light of low
      intensity, stimulated spore germination as well as the vegetative growth of
      mycelium.[25]\_Argon\_and\_helium\_lasers\_also contributed to the acceleration
      of fruit body development by 36\u201351%.[2][26]\r\n\n<b>Wild strains\r</b>\nWild
      strains of\_Hericium\_spp. can be isolated and cultivated by first gathering
      fruiting bodies from fallen trees in the natural habitat. The fruiting bodies
      can then be opened to attain pieces of their inner spore-producing tissue.
      This tissue is then placed onto\_petri dishes\_with\_agar\_to cultivate fungal
      colonies at 25\_\xB0C. After several transfers to new petri dishes to verify
      the purity of the strain, it can be kept at -80\_\xB0C for long-term storage.[27]"
