  - title: 'Known as: Chaga'
    description: "Inonotus obliquus, commonly known as\_chaga\_(a\_Latinisation\_of
      the Russian word \u0447\u0430\u0433\u0430), is a\_fungus\_in the family\_Hymenochaetaceae.
      It is\_parasitic\_on\_birch\_and other trees. The sterile\_conk\_is irregularly
      formed and has the appearance of burnt charcoal. It is not the\_fruiting body\_of
      the fungus, but a\_sclerotium\_or mass of\_mycelium, mostly black because of
      the presence of massive amounts of\_melanin.[2]\_Some people consider chaga
      to be medicinal.[3] \r\n\r\nI. obliquus\_is found most commonly in the\_Circumboreal
      Region\_of the Northern Hemisphere, where it is distributed in birch forests.[4] "

  - title: Morphology
    description: "I. obliquus\_causes a white\_heart rot\_to develop in the host
      tree. The chaga spores enter the tree through wounds, particularly poorly healed
      branch stubs. The white rot decay will spread throughout the\_heartwood\_of
      the host. During the infection cycle, penetration of the\_sapwood\_occurs only
      around the sterile exterior\_mycelium\_mass.[4]\_The chaga fungus will continue
      to cause decay within the living tree for 10\u201380+ years. While the tree
      is alive, only sterile mycelial masses are produced (the black exterior conk).
      The sexual stage begins after the tree, or some portion of the tree, is killed
      by the infection.\_I. obliquus\_will begin to produce fertile fruiting bodies
      underneath the bark. These bodies begin as a whitish mass that turn to brown
      with time. Since the sexual stage occurs almost entirely under the bark, the
      fruiting body is rarely seen.[5]\_These fruiting bodies produce\_basidiospores\_which
      will spread the infection to other vulnerable trees."

  - title: 'Common names '
    description: "The name\_chaga\_(/\u02C8t\u0283\u0251\u02D0\u0261\u0259/\_) comes
      from the Russian name of the fungus (transliterated\_from\_\u0447\u0430\u0433\u0430),
      which in turn is purportedly derived from the word for the fungus in\_Komi-Permyak,
      the language of the\_indigenous peoples\_in the\_Kama River Basin, west of
      the\_Ural Mountains. It is also known as the clinker polypore (from its resemblance
      to the slag left after a coal fire, known commonly as \"clinker\" when coal
      fires were common), cinder\_conk, black mass and birch canker polypore.[6]\_In\_England\_and
      officially in Canada, it is known as the sterile conk trunk rot of birch.[7]"

  - title: Distribution and cultivation
    description: "Generally found growing on birch (Betula\_spp.) trees, it has also
      been found on alder (Alnus\_spp.), beech (Fagus\_spp.), oak (Quercus\_spp.)
      and poplar (Populus\_spp.).[8]\_In species other than birch, the fungus often
      appears as buried stem canker, instead of the charcoal-like mass found on birch
      trees.[citation needed]\r\nAttempts at\_cultivating\_this fungus on\_potato
      dextrose agar\_and other simulated\_mediums\_resulted in a reduced and markedly
      different production of metabolites.[9][10]\_Cultivated chaga developed a reduced
      number of\_phytosterols, particularly\_lanosterol, an intermediate in the synthesis
      of\_ergosterol\_and\_lanostane-type\_triterpenes.[9]"

      of\_melanin.[11][12]\_Chaga has been reported to contain extremely high concentrations
      of\_oxalate, 2800\u201311200 mg total oxalates/100 g sclerotium, one of the
      highest reported levels of any organism.[13] "

  - title: 'Preparation '
    description: "Chaga is traditionally grated into a fine powder and used to brew
      a beverage resembling\_coffee\_or\_tea. However, caution is warranted with
      chronic use due to the extremely high concentrations of oxalates in chaga.
      Currently, three extraction processes are used.\r\n\uF0B7Hot water extraction
      is one of the most common preparations. A decoction is created by simmering
      pieces of the chaga in numerous quarts of water until the water is reduced
      and the remaining liquid contains a portion of the chaga's concentrated water-soluble
      compounds. Such preparations, produced in China and Japan, are exported worldwide.
      The \xDF-D-glucans may have a content of approximately 35% in a pure extract.[14]\_If
      chaga tea is prepared at home, the chaga chunks can be reused multiple times.\r\n\uF0B7Ethanol\_or\_methanol\_extraction
      isolates the water-insoluble components, betulinic acid, betulin and the phytosterols.
      This extraction process is in general used as a second step after hot-water
      extraction, since ethanol alone will not break down\_chitin\_effectively\u2014heat
      is essential.\r\n\uF0B7Fermentation\_is the most time-consuming and most expensive.
      Because fermentation methods are not standardized (many types of bacteria and
      fungi can be used in the process), the outcome is also not standardized."
