      hyphae. The\_phialides\_are arranged in tufts with narrow angles at the top,
      similar to the branching hyphae found in\_Trichoderma\_species. The conidia
      are roughly spherical with a truncate base in each spore, pale green in color,
      and measure 2.5\u20133.5\_\u03BCm in diameter. Their surfaces are almost smooth,
      but sometimes appearing very faintly roughened with light microscopy.[7] "

  - title: 'Toxicity '
    description: "Several poisonings have been reported in Japan resulting from the
      consumption of the fungus. In 1999, one of a group of five people from\_Niigata
      prefecture\_died two days after consuming about 1 gram (0.035\_oz) of fruit
      body that had been soaked in\_sake. In 2000, an individual from\_Gunma prefecture\_died
      after eating the fried mushroom. Symptoms associated with consumption in these
      cases included stomach pains, changes in perception, decrease in the number
      of\_leukocytes\_and\_thrombocytes, peeling skin on the face, hair loss, and
      shrinking of the\_cerebellum, resulting in\_speech impediment\_and problems
      with voluntary movement.[8]\_In another instance, an\_autopsy\_revealed\_multiple
      organ failure, including acute\_kidney failure, liver\_necrosis\_and\_disseminated
      intravascular coagulation.[9]\_In one case of poisoning, the patient suffered
      from\_hemophagocytosis, in addition to severe\_leukocytopenia\_and\_thrombocytopenia,
      seven days after ingesting the fungus.\_Plasmapheresis\_and administration
      of\_granulocyte colony-stimulating factor\_were used to treat the blood abnormalities.
      The authors suggested that these treatments, in addition to the large volume
      of administered\_intravenous\_saline - 9 liters (2.0\_imp\_gal; 2.4\_U.S.\_gal)
      over a 12-hour period\u2014were responsible for his successful recovery.[10]\r\nThe
      poisoning symptoms are similar to those observed previously with animals that
      had consumed\_trichothecene\_mycotoxins. Japanese researchers detected the
      presence of the\_macrocyclic\_trichothecenes\_satratoxin H, satratoxin H 12\u2032,13\u2032-diacetate,
      satratoxin H 12\u2032-acetate, and satratoxin H 13\u2032-acetate. When grown
      in\_liquid culture\_the fungus additionally produces roridin E and verrucarin
      J. With the exception of verrucarin J, a 500-microgram dose of any of these
      compounds, when injected into the abdomen of mice, will result in their death
      the following day.[8]\_It has been claimed that touching the fungus can cause
      skin rashes, but this is controversial.[6]\r"
