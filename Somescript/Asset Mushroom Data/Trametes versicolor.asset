    description: "Trametes versicolor\_\u2013 also known as\_Coriolus versicolor\_and\_Polyporus
      versicolor\_\u2013 is a common\_polypore\_mushroom\_found throughout the world.
      Meaning 'of several colors',\_versicolor\_reliably describes this fungus that
      displays different colors. For example, because its shape and multiple colors
      are similar to those of a\_wild turkey,\_T. versicolor\_is commonly called\_turkey
      tail. A similar looking mushroom, commonly called\_false turkey tail, which
      is from a different order, may sometimes be confused with the turkey tail mushroom
      due to appearance. Another lookalike is the\_multicolor gill polypore.[1]"

    description: "The top surface of the cap shows typical concentric zones of different
      colors, and the margin is always the lightest.[1]\_The flesh is 1\u20133\_mm
      thick and has leathery texture. Older specimens, such as the one pictured,
      can have zones with green algae growing on them, thus appearing green. It commonly
      grows in tiled layers on in groups or rows on logs and stumps of deciduous
      trees, and is very common in North America.[1]\_The mushroom is stalkless and
      the cap is rust-brown or darker brown, sometimes with blackish zones. The cap
      is flat, up to 8\_\xD7\_5 x 0.5\u20131\_cm in area. It is often triangular
      or round, with zones of fine hairs. The pore surface is whitish to light brown,
      with pores round and with age twisted and labyrinthine. 3\u20138 pores per
      millimeter.\r\nIt may be eaten by\_caterpillars\_of the\_fungus moth\_Nemaxera
      betulinella\_and by\_maggots\_of the\_Platypezid\_fly\_Polyporivora picta.[2]\_and
      the fungus gnat\_Mycetophila luctuosa,[3]\_but is considered inedible to humans.[4]"
